# About Frdlweb
The `Frdlweb` project is maintained and owned by [Till Wehowski](https://domainundhomepagespeicher.webfan.de/portifolio--welche-produkte-und-techniken-bietet-domainundhomepagespeicher,de-im-detail.248.html), a coder and webhoster located in Bochum (Germany).

It was founded in the late 90s by [Georg Wehowski](https://wehowski.de) as a hobby project serving a free-time single groups platform and became a commercial webhosting provider since 2004, known as [`Homepagespeicher`](https://homepagespeicher.de/ueber-uns.html) nowadays.

Its main intend is to brand and group the development and productional infrastructure used by the Wehowskis, their hard- and software, as well as to provide open and non-profit software products and microservices to the public.

Please note that ***frdl*** is an abbreviation of the german word `"freundlich"`, meaning `"friendly"` in english. 

So at least, we the Wehowskis, our friends, partners, customers and users, we **make** the ***Frdlweb*** all together!
