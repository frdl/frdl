# Frdlweb CDN

Our Content Delivery Network, the `Frdlweb CDN` ( `cdn.frdl.de` ) is powered by (a proxy random race of):
* [Frdl](https://frdl.de) | - [Implementation-Example](https://github.com/frdl/translations#onpage-multilanguage-example)
* [JSDELIVR](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)
* [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/)

For example, the Frdlweb CDN is the host of our [webfan-website.js project](https://cdn.frdl.de/@webfan3/frdlweb/), wich runs most of the webfans/frdlwebs websites javascripts event this site.

If you want to run your own content on our CDN, you can start with [Webfan Hub](https://webfan.io/), so far.
